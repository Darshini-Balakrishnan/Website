### Redesign Visualizations of an Poverty Bad graph

This is a project of redesigning a original graph which had flaws. I have made three different visualizations from the data which i have gathered from the original graph and supporting dataset to improve the visualization by making the graphs more informative.

<br>

### Original Graph

This is a visualization of a graph representing Extreme Poverty Rate of various countries categorized by the poverty percentage in the year 2021. Conclusions from this graph are difficult to be made since the countries with the least poverty percentages are smaller in size and there are too much graphics which will make the users bored and more time consuming for the audience to extract the required information. The visualization does not conclude the poverty rates from different time periods as well. This bad graph can be redesigned as follows to make the information laid out more clearly and precisely.

<br>

### Redesign Visualizations

<br>

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
poverty = read.csv("Poverty.csv")

poverty$X..of.population <- gsub(",", ".", poverty$X..of.population)

mapdata <- map_data("world") %>% as_tibble()

poverty <- poverty %>% rename(region = Country)

mapdata <- left_join(mapdata, poverty, by="region")

mapdata <-mapdata %>% filter(!is.na(mapdata$Population))

mapdata$X..of.population <- as.numeric(as.character(mapdata$X..of.population))

map1 <- ggplot(mapdata, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, text = paste(region, ": ", Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty, "M"))) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = X..of.population), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red", name = "Poverty %") +
  labs(title = "Poverty Percentage by Region") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

map1_plotly <- ggplotly(map1, tooltip = "text")

map1_plotly
```

<br>

This is a representation of the world map filled in a color gradient according to the percentage of poverty from low (green) and high(red). Particular regions can be selected from the dropdown and the map of that particular state along with count of population will be shown. This will enable the audience to view the required information in a faster way along with the exact count of population in extreme poverty.

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}

selectedValues <- c("Australia", "Bahamas", "Finland")
povertybar <- poverty[poverty$region %in% selectedValues, ]
      povertybar$Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty <- gsub(",", "", povertybar$Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty)
      povertybar$Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty <- as.numeric(povertybar$Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty)
  
      Bargraph <- ggplot(povertybar, aes(x = region, y = Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty, fill = region, text = paste("Population:", Total.number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty, "M"))) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        scale_fill_discrete(name = "Region") + 
        labs(title = "Poverty Comparison among Regions",
             y = "Population (M)", x = "Country") +
        theme_minimal() +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))+
        scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
      
      ggplotly(Bargraph, tooltip = "text")
```

<br>

The above bar graph is an example of three different countries representing the population of people in extreme poverty in Millions. This redesign aims to portray the comparison of the count of population in extreme poverty with an interactive UI so that users can make choices of comparison according to the country they need to compare. Multiple countries can be selected to make the comparisons between them and conclude analysis.

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
poverty = read.csv("Poverty.csv")

poverty_year = read.csv("C:/Users/darsh/Desktop/STAT 515/Mid Project/Population in poverty.csv")

poverty_year$Entity <- gsub("\\(.*?\\)", "", poverty_year$Entity)

poverty_year <- poverty_year %>% rename(Country = Entity)

poverty_year <- poverty_year %>% rename(Poverty.Percentage = X.2.15.a.day...Share.of.population.in.poverty)

CountryValue <- c("Australia", "Albania")
poverty_filtered <- poverty_year[poverty_year$Country %in% CountryValue,]
library(plotly)

p <- ggplot(poverty_filtered, aes(x = Year, y = Poverty.Percentage, color = Country)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point() +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(title = paste("Poverty Percentage Over Years"),
           y = "Poverty Percentage", x = "Year")+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
    
    ggplotly(p)

```

<br>

The Line chart displays the change in poverty percentage over a period of time, where the original graph does not contain the data over the years. This will be useful for the users to compare the change in poverty percentage over a period of time between multiple countries and a particular country's information can also be retrieved according to the choice made. The points on the line give's information of the year and the poverty rate at that particular time periods. The time period data was collected from the "Our world data in data" to make the visualization more informative.
