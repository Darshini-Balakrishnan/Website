I'm Darshini Balakrishnan, currently advancing my studies in the Data Analytics and Engineering Master's program at George Mason University, located in Fairfax, VA. My enthusiasm for technology drives my proficiency in a variety of programming languages, including Python, R, and SQL, alongside my experience with web development frameworks such as Angular, not to mention my skills in HTML and CSS. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Technology degree from the Coimbatore Institute of Technology in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India, setting a solid foundation for my ongoing pursuits in the tech field. I have also gained practical experience as a Product Engineer at Tekizma India Solutions Private Limited in Bangalore, further enriching my skills and expertise in the technology sector.
